# Deduplication-In-Cloud
Finding and removing duplicate files like docx, pdf, PNG from clouds
I have uses algorithms like MD5, AES and Amazon AWS cloud to store files. Deduplication
is performed by comparing hash codes of the files generated using MD5.
For future work I am going to perform deduplication on video
files.
Any suggestions are welcomed.
To run this project on cloud one has to create an account on Amazon and then
create an instance of the project.
Note: Please use Google Chrome on AWS for better speed.
